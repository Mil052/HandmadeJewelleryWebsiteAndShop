## App description

Project is made in Next.Js(React framework).
Project will consist of two parts:
* Website and online shop
* CMS dedicated to the administrator to manage page content. 

## How to run the code:

* Download the code and instal dependencies (in the project directory run: `npm install`)
* Run the app in the development mode (In the project directory run: `npm run dev`, then open http://localhost:3000 in the browser)  
You can also see page previev here: http://miru.mgwebsites.eu/  
It is only a previev (a static export from Next.Js) because on my hosting I have no possibility to run another Node.js server.
